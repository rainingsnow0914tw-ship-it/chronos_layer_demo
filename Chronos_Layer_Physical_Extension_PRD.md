🕰️ Time-Anchored AR Polaroid
1-Page Pitch (English | Competition Version)
One-liner

Time-Anchored AR Polaroid turns AI historical reconstruction into a collectible on-site experience: visitors receive a chemically developed Polaroid, and by scanning it, reveal an AI-generated short video that brings a lost moment in history back to life.

The problem

Heritage sites struggle to make the past tangible and emotionally engaging

Purely digital AR content is easy to forget

AI generation lacks a physical anchor in the real world

Core experience

Visitor takes a photo at a heritage site

A historical period is selected or inferred

A WIDE or SQUARE Polaroid is printed on site

Scanning the photo reveals a 3–10s AI-generated historical video

The video can be saved to the visitor’s phone (with AI disclosure)

Why a physical Polaroid

Physical photos act as trusted memory anchors

Chemical development, grain, and imperfection provide an analog counter-tone to AI’s digital precision

This is an experience device, not a filter or a printer

Why WIDE / SQUARE (not MINI)

The focus is heritage, architecture, and space, not selfies

WIDE preserves spatial scale

SQUARE balances people and environment while remaining collectible

MINI compresses depth and framing, weakening historical storytelling

Technical overview

Computer vision: segmentation, pose, scene anchoring

AI reconstruction: buildings, environment, wardrobe

Image-to-video generation (Veo 3.1)

Image-based AR triggering using the photo itself

Design rule: minimal human motion, atmospheric environmental motion, clear AI labeling

Key insight: Latency Hiding

Polaroid chemical development naturally takes 60–120 seconds.
This physical wait time is used to complete cloud video generation and AR binding, effectively hiding AI latency from the user.

Feasibility & cost

Built entirely with existing, production-ready technologies

Estimated cost per experience:

Low-latency (3–5s video): USD 1.1 – 2.6

High-fidelity (8–15s video): USD 1.75 – 6.0

Collaboration potential

Heritage sites & museums: premium experiences + physical souvenirs

AI platforms (e.g., Google): showcase multimodal AI, maps, and cultural data integration

Scalable across multiple cultural landmarks worldwide

MVP scope

One site, one historical period

One wardrobe template

One 5-second video template
