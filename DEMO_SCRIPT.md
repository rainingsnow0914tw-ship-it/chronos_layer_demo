### [0:00-0:15] Opening (15 seconds)

**Visual**: Title card → Problem images (ruins, modern intrusions)

**Voice-over**:
```
Historical sites face two critical problems:
physical decay and the imagination gap.
Chronos Layer solves both using AI-powered
multimodal time reconstruction.
```

### [1:05-2:20] Himeji Castle - HERO Demo (75 seconds) ⭐️

**This is the centerpiece. Slow down and explain thoroughly.**

#### Part 1: Introduction (15 seconds) [1:05-1:20]

**Visual**: 
- Click Himeji Castle card
- Zoom in on "NEW" badge
- Show modern tourist photo

**Voice-over**:
```
Now, our breakthrough feature: personal time travel.
Instead of just reconstructing buildings,
Chronos Layer transforms YOU into history.

```

**Pacing**: Excited but clear  
**Emphasis**: "personal time travel", "transforms YOU", "sixteen hundred"

#### Part 2: AI Reasoning Process (30 seconds) [1:20-1:50]

**Visual**:
- Time Guide scrolling (pause 2 seconds per line)
- Highlight each step as you mention it

**Voice-over**:
```
Watch the AI reasoning process on screen.

First, Gemini Vision analyzes the photo—
your posture, the lighting, your position at the castle.

Second, Maps A-P-I identifies the precise location:
Himeji Castle, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan.

Third, Books A-P-I researches historical documentation—
in this case, Sengoku period armor from sixteen hundred.

Fourth, Gemini Reasoning validates every detail:
armor style, helmet ornaments, family crests.
Everything must be historically accurate.

Finally, Imagen Three generates the transformation,
preserving your facial features
while placing you in authentic period attire.
```

**Pacing**: 
- Slow and methodical
- Pause 1 second between API mentions
- Emphasize technical terms clearly

**Pronunciation Guide**:
- "A-P-I" (not "ay-pee-eye")
- "Imagen Three" (not "Imagen 3")
- "Sengoku" = "SEN-go-ku"

**Emphasis**:
- "Gemini Vision"
- "Maps API"
- "Books API"
- "Gemini Reasoning"
- "Imagen Three"
- "preserving your facial features"

---

#### Part 3: Result Showcase (30 seconds) [1:50-2:20]

**Visual**:
- Slow before/after slider
- Zoom in on armor details
- Zoom in on face (showing preservation)
- Pan to background (castle town)

**Voice-over**:
```
The result: you're now a Sengoku warrior
in sixteen hundred A-D.

Notice the red and black Tosei-gusoku armor—
historically accurate for this era.
The deer antler helmet ornament signifies high rank.

But most importantly, it's still YOU.
Your facial features are preserved.
This isn't a face-swap—
it's evidence-based historical reconstruction.

The background shows the castle town marketplace:
wooden shops, teahouses, townspeople in period clothing.
Every detail researched and validated.
```

**Pacing**: Slow, let visuals breathe  
**Emphasis**: 
- "it's still YOU"
- "not a face-swap"
- "evidence-based historical reconstruction"

---

### [2:20-2:50] Technical Summary (30 seconds)

**Visual**:
- Show Architecture diagram
- Highlight API connections

**Voice-over**:
```
Under the hood, Chronos Layer orchestrates six Google A-P-Is:

Gemini Vision for scene analysis,
Maps for location identification,
Books for historical research,
Search for contextual data,
Gemini Reasoning for validation,
and Imagen Three for generation.

This isn't just image editing.
It's a complete multimodal reasoning pipeline
that researches, validates, and reconstructs history.
```

**Pacing**: Technical but accessible  
**Emphasis**: 
- Count clearly: "six Google APIs"
- "multimodal reasoning pipeline"
- "researches, validates, and reconstructs"

---

### [2:50-3:00] Closing (10 seconds)

**Visual**: 
- Show all 5 landmarks

Making history participatory, not just observable.

Thank you.
```

**Pacing**: Confident conclusion  
**Emphasis**: "participatory, not just observable"

## 📝 Alternative Script: Non-Technical Version

**Use this if your audience is less technical:**

### Himeji Castle Section (Simplified):

```
Now, our breakthrough feature: personal time travel.

Watch how the AI thinks through this transformation.

It looks at your photo and figures out where you are.
Then it researches what people wore back then—
in this case, samurai armor from four hundred years ago.
It checks every detail to make sure it's historically accurate.
Then it transforms you while keeping your face recognizable.

The result: you're a Sengoku warrior, but it's still you.
Not a filter, not a face-swap.
Real historical reconstruction based on documented evidence.
```

## 🎯 Delivery Tips

### 1. Pacing Strategy
- **Slow sections**: Opening, Himeji (Part 2), Technical Summary
- **Normal sections**: Ruins of Saint Paul's, Closing
- **Fast sections**: Guia, St. Dominic's

### 2. Emphasis Words
When you emphasize, use slight pause + volume:
```
"This isn't just image editing.  [pause]
It's a complete... multimodal reasoning pipeline."
```

### 3. Technical Terms
Pronounce clearly, slightly slower:
- **Gemini** = "JEM-in-eye"
- **Imagen** = "im-AH-hen"
- **Multimodal** = "multi-MODE-al"
- **API** = "A-P-I" (spell it out)

### 4. Breath Marks
Insert natural breaths at commas and periods.
Don't rush—3 minutes is longer than you think!

### 5. Energy Level
```
[0:00-0:15] Opening → Authoritative
[0:15-1:05] Quick demos → Energetic
[1:05-2:20] Himeji → Detailed, educational
[2:20-2:50] Technical → Professional
[2:50-3:00] Closing → Confident
```
